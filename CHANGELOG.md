## [0.3.0] — Unreleased

### Added

- `Wheel.add(initial_block_result=...)` starts a block from an explicit injection
  or other complete result without consuming campaign RNG draws. It uses the
  usual validation, copied state, domain translation, and covariance ownership.
  `check_block` accepts the same required starting result, demonstrated in
  `examples/create_block.ipynb`.
- `transform` converts observations, covariance, and block results between time,
  frequency, and WDM representations. `WDMGrid` validates dependent division
  counts; the optional local WDM backend is loaded lazily.
- Native WDM covariance and exact `TranslatedCovariance` operators preserve
  induced correlations, statistical exclusions, quadratic forms, and coordinate
  normalization without a diagonal approximation or dense observation matrix.
- Per-block representation selection in `Wheel.add` translates the residual,
  covariance, and current signal together and adopts returned outputs on the
  canonical observation grid. A runnable translation example checks both grid
  selectors and covariance weights against the real optional backend.
- `DataCovariance` stores coefficient covariance on an explicit observation grid,
  with point × channel × channel matrices, an inference mask, PSD/variance
  factories, and marginal noise weights. Active matrices are positive definite.
- `Ledger` provides defensive snapshots of each block's complete `BlockResult`:
  optional `tdi_signal_contribution` and `noise_covariance`, physical
  `model_parameters`, algorithm continuation `sampler_state`, and diagnostics
  in `metadata`. `ledger.snapshot()` returns an independent dictionary for
  inspection; the Ledger itself compares by identity.
- `examples/requirements-gb.txt` installs the external galactic-binary example
  stack separately from core dependencies. Its preflight checks and documented
  Python/platform requirements make the optional example easier to run.

### Changed

- Change the project license from MIT to Apache License 2.0.
- The core NumPy floor is 1.26.4, tested independently of the numeric-orbit
  dependencies on Python 3.12. CI and release gates also run optional WDM
  integration against a pinned backend revision.
- Blocks require only `name` and
  `sample(conditional_residual, noise_covariance, current_block_result, *, rng)`.
  Both `Wheel.add` and `check_block` require a complete, non-None
  `initial_block_result`; initialization is explicit campaign setup, with no
  prior-drawing hook in the protocol. Instances hold fixed configuration; Wheel
  owns accepted model and sampler state.
- Wheel maintains independent `observed_data` and `working_residual`, the current
  `noise_covariance`, a ledger, and its RNG. Each block receives the observations
  minus all other blocks' accepted signals. Result, covariance, residual, and RNG
  adoption is atomic; a failed call leaves that block's accepted state intact.
  A persistent balanced tree caches signal sums for logarithmic block replacement
  and exclusion. Internal covariance snapshots avoid repeated factorization while
  new covariance publications retain validation.
- Every block result is a complete snapshot. A missing signal means zero and
  removes any previous contribution. Noise-only blocks publish covariance directly.
  The current covariance owner must always return its full covariance; another
  block taking ownership emits `NoiseOverwrittenWarning`.
- Covariance is explicit: pass `initial_noise_covariance` to Wheel or publish it
  from a block. `None` starts a campaign without covariance. PSD models are
  converted with `DataCovariance.from_psd(reference_data, noise_psd_model)`;
  `from_variance(reference_data, time_sample_variance)` builds time covariance.
  Weighting helpers are methods of `DataCovariance`.
- `L1Data` carries channel arrays and observation conventions, with descriptive
  field names and units. Scientific aliases `fs`, `dt`, `N`, `Tobs`, `df`, `fny`,
  and `t0` are supported notation. Orbit interfaces name GPS times, positions in
  metres, nominal arm length, and transfer frequency explicitly.
- `on_cycle_complete(cycle_index, wheel)` runs after a full cycle accepts, with a
  zero-based index local to each `run`. It does not run for a partially failed cycle.
- Examples prepare injected values or prior draws in setup, with explicit
  continuation state and callback history
  collection. EchoBlock counts accepted calls in `sampler_state["num_sample_calls"]`;
  the GB example restores Eryn state and refreshes conditional likelihoods.
- Release builds test the packaged source before publication and use a pinned
  PEP 517 backend. Dependency-floor tests preserve their resolved environment;
  notebook setup installs project extras before external model dependencies.

### Fixed

- `L1Data.to_time()` and `to_frequency()` share `transform()` validation and
  return independent arrays, including same-domain calls. Edited arrays with
  invalid lengths or Fourier endpoints cannot bypass validation.
- Fourier normalization widens complex64 input before scaling, preserving
  representable results that would otherwise underflow or overflow.
- Covariance log determinants use Cholesky factors, avoiding NumPy 1.26 warnings
  for valid complex positive-definite matrices without suppressing diagnostics.
- `Block.name` is a read-only protocol property, so frozen dataclasses satisfy
  the same public typing contract as mutable configurations, including explicit
  protocol subclasses.
- Manual release dispatches cannot publish, even when run against a tag.
- Source archives include linked specifications and their reusable scientific
  template. Historical API descriptions are labeled and removed-source links
  target their recorded baseline.
- The optional GB example constrains NumPy below 2.4 because released Eryn 1.2.6
  calls the removed `numpy.in1d` function. This upper bound applies only to the
  example dependencies.
- Covariance symmetry checks scale to each channel pair, so a loud channel cannot
  hide asymmetry in quieter channels. Accepted numerical roundoff is symmetrized
  before Cholesky validation and storage.
- NumericOrbit copies its input arrays and rejects nonfinite query times, keeping
  caller mutations and invalid times from changing its interpolation bounds.
- Observation and block-result spectra require real DC coefficients and real
  Nyquist coefficients for even time-series lengths.
- Residuals subtract aggregated signals from pristine observations, preserving
  the data when large block contributions cancel. Signal sums use at least
  float64 or complex128 precision.

### Removed

- Noise storage and weighting helpers on observation data. Covariance is managed
  separately through `DataCovariance` and Wheel.
- Separate noise-block and stateful-block contracts; signal, noise, and joint
  models use the same stateless `Block` protocol.
- Heuristic signal-withdrawal warnings. An omitted or explicit zero signal removes
  the block's previous contribution.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-29

First working release of the blocked-Gibbs orchestration layer.

### Added
- `Residuals`: the frozen cross-group data contract — TDI arrays plus run
  settings, with a required `observable` field (`domain` defaults to `"time"`,
  `epoch` to `0.0`), long/short name aliases (`Tobs`, `fs`, `dt`, ...), a typo
  catcher, and full self-validation on every construction (tdi/channels
  consistency, per-domain array lengths, orbit-must-span-data).
  `n_samples` is derived from the tdi arrays for time-domain data (where they
  carry it exactly) and required only for frequency-domain data, where the
  rfft grid loses the parity of n — 513 bins are consistent with n=1024 and
  n=1025, which imply different `Tobs`/`df`, so it is asked for rather than
  guessed. This moved `n_samples` after the required fields, so construct
  `Residuals` by keyword (positional construction changed shape).
  `noise_variance()` gives the per-sample variance a time-domain likelihood
  needs (PSD integrated over the grid, Nyquist half-weighted, so it does not
  depend on the parity of `n_samples`). `dtype` is part of the validated
  contract (floating or complex; integer and object arrays are refused at
  construction rather than failing inside the Wheel), `channels` is normalised
  to a tuple, and equality is identity-based so comparing two `Residuals` no
  longer raises a numpy error.
  `to_frequency()` / `to_time()` transform a dataset between representations,
  carrying `n_samples` (so the round trip is exact for either parity) and
  applying the campaign's `X(f) = dt * rfft(x)` convention in code rather than
  in prose -- the same convention `noise_psd` is normalized against, which a
  test now pins. Since data enters as a time series and transforms from there,
  `n_samples` never needs stating by hand in the normal workflow.
- Vocabulary, settled before the first release so none of it needs a
  deprecation period. Three nested scales get three words, and no word does
  double duty:
  a **cycle** is one pass over every block (`Wheel.run(n_cycles=...)`,
  `on_cycle=...`, `check_block(n_cycles=...)`);
  a **block update** is one block's turn within that pass
  (`Block.update(residual)`);
  a **step** is what a block's own sampler does, many times, inside a single
  `update()` call (`steps_per_cycle` in the GB example).
  The unit itself is a **block** (`Block`, `NoiseBlock`, `EchoBlock`,
  `check_block`, `enchilada.block`) -- the word blocked Gibbs already uses for
  a jointly-updated group of parameters. "Iteration" and "sweep" are not used
  as API names: the first could mean any of the three scales, and the second
  invites confusion with a block's own sampler steps. Note for anyone reading
  GLASS alongside this: GLASS's `cycle` means repeat updates of a single
  module, which is not what enchilada calls a cycle.
- `Block` protocol — two methods, `start(residual)` and `update(residual)`,
  each returning the updated residual. The residual handed to a block is
  the data minus every *other* block (its own model excluded), so the
  block fits it directly and subtracts its new model — there is no
  add-back to forget. Everything else — parameters, RNG, chains, checkpoints,
  and the block's own current model — is block-internal state the Wheel
  never sees. Noise is not special: a noise block returns the residual with
  an updated `noise` object (a zero ledger entry), consumed via
  `Residuals.noise_psd` (documented interface `psd(freqs[, channel])`).
- `NoiseOverwrittenWarning`: `Residuals.noise` is a single slot, so when a
  second block writes it the first block's model is simply gone -- the Wheel
  does not combine noise models. That was documented but undetected; it now
  warns, naming both blocks and the fix (publish one combined model from a
  single noise block, or make the foreground a signal block where the ledger
  *does* combine). It stays a warning rather than an error because handing
  ownership between blocks may be deliberate, and it deliberately stays quiet
  for the two legitimate cases: one noise block re-estimating every cycle, and
  a noise block taking over the model the dataset arrived with.
- `Wheel` boundary guards: `add` verifies `name`/`start`/`update` before
  registering anything; a returned residual may not drop the noise model
  (symmetric with the existing orbit check) and may not contain NaN/inf, which
  would otherwise be recorded as that block's model and handed to every
  block updated later; and because the ledger is derived, the Wheel warns
  when a previously non-zero model becomes exactly zero (a block that returns
  the residual unchanged silently withdraws itself from the fit).
- `Wheel`: the Gibbs ring, owning the pristine data and a per-block ledger
  (each block's current model). It hands each block the data minus every
  other model and derives that block's new ledger entry from what it
  returns, so the residual bookkeeping — and the add-back — lives in the
  framework, not the block (the split the GLASS global fit uses). Atomic
  registration, per-update validation that the returned residual kept the fixed
  run settings, `residual(exclude=...)` and `contribution(name)` accessors,
  and an `on_cycle` callback on `run`.
- `NumericOrbit`: tabulated ephemerides with cubic-spline interpolation,
  loaders for LDC/Mojito HDF5 files and lisaorbits objects
  (validated against lisaorbits 3.0.3), equatorial-to-ecliptic frame
  rotation, and a hard refusal to extrapolate outside the tabulated span.
- `enchilada.testing`: `EchoBlock` and the `check_block` conformance
  helper for third-party block implementations.
- Examples: `examples/demo.py` (plumbing walkthrough), `examples/demo.ipynb`
  (annotated notebook incl. orbits), `examples/toy_fit.py` (a converging
  two-source + sampled-noise Gibbs fit), and
  `examples/gb_block_eryn.ipynb` + `examples/gb_model.py` -- a real LISA
  source class (GBGPU waveforms, an Eryn sampler inside the block, a fixed
  LISA Analysis Tools PSD) recovering an injected galactic binary through the
  Wheel. That one needs an external stack (`gbgpu`, `eryn`,
  `lisaanalysistools`, `matplotlib`, `corner`) that is deliberately not a
  enchilada dependency, so it is not exercised by CI.
- Ergonomics: `enchilada.replace` re-exports `dataclasses.replace`, so updating
  a residual needs no second import; `Block` is `runtime_checkable`, so
  `isinstance(obj, Block)` is a usable registration check. (`NoiseBlock`
  deliberately is *not*: it declares no member beyond `Block`, so a
  runtime check against it would return True for every block.)
- `ModelWithdrawnWarning`: the withdrawal heuristic raises a named, filterable
  category rather than a bare `RuntimeWarning`, since a legitimate RJMCMC death
  move is indistinguishable from a forgotten re-subtraction from outside the
  block. Filter it if your sampler does death moves; `check_block`
  escalates it to an error, because a conformance check is exactly where the
  strict reading belongs.
- Packaging and release: installable via uv or pip (uv_build backend),
  numpy-only core, `numeric-orbits` and `examples` extras, MIT license, PEP 561
  `py.typed` marker (with `check_untyped_defs`, so unannotated bodies are
  checked too -- consumers' type checkers trust these annotations). CI runs
  ruff (lint + format), mypy, and the suite behind a 95% coverage gate on
  Python 3.12/3.13 across Linux and macOS, plus a numpy-only leg through 3.14,
  a dependency-floors leg, an installed-wheel smoke test, and an sdist leg that
  unpacks the archive and runs the packaged suite from it -- so "the sdist is
  self-testing" is verified rather than asserted. Tagging `v*` re-runs the
  whole gate, checks the tag against the project version as parsed versions,
  and publishes through PyPI Trusted Publishing (no token exists to leak).
