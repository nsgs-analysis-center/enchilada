Blocked-Gibbs global-fit orchestration for LISA.

*The whole enchilada*: a global fit infers every source population and the
instrument noise **together**, because none of them can be measured cleanly
without the others. This is the layer that makes that one joint fit out of
many separately-owned pieces.

A LISA global fit has to jointly infer many source populations (galactic
binaries, massive black-hole binaries, ...) plus the instrument noise, with
each block typically owned by a different group and sampler. enchilada is the
orchestration layer — and only that. A `Wheel` keeps the pristine data and a
**ledger** of each block's current model, and hands every registered
`Block` the data minus *every other* block — exactly the residual that
block should fit. The block fits it, subtracts its new model, and returns;
the Wheel reads the block's new ledger entry off the difference. So blocked
Gibbs falls out of the ring, and there is no "add-back" for a block to
forget. No waveforms, no likelihoods, and no samplers live here; those belong
to the blocks (which own their sampler state and can wrap code in any
language), while the Wheel owns only the residual bookkeeping.

## Install

Requires Python ≥ 3.12 (floor set by lisaorbits).

```sh
pip install enchilada      # or: uv add enchilada
```

To work on enchilada itself, clone it and use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada.git
cd enchilada
uv sync
```

or with pip: `pip install -e .`

The core package depends only on numpy. Loading tabulated spacecraft
ephemerides (`enchilada.orbits.NumericOrbit`) needs the extra:

```sh
uv sync --extra numeric-orbits   # adds h5py, scipy, lisaorbits
uv sync --extra examples         # adds jupyterlab for the notebooks
```

## Quickstart

```sh
uv run python examples/demo.py
```

runs three Gibbs cycles over two no-op `EchoBlock`s on synthetic data —
enough to watch the Wheel hand each block its residual. The whole thing is:

<!-- runnable -->
```python
import numpy as np
from enchilada import L1Data, Wheel
from enchilada.testing import EchoBlock

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
n_samples = 1024
channels = ("A", "E", "T")

# One frozen object holds the TDI arrays and the run settings everyone shares.
observed = L1Data(
    tdi={ch: rng.standard_normal(n_samples) for ch in channels},
    sample_rate=0.1,
    channels=channels,
    tdi_generation="2.0",
    observable="fractional_frequency",
)   # n_samples is read off the arrays; epoch defaults to 0.0

ucb = EchoBlock(name="ucb")
mbhb = EchoBlock(name="mbhb")

wheel = Wheel(observed)
wheel.add(ucb)
wheel.add(mbhb)
wheel.run(n_cycles=3)

wheel.residual()   # the running residual: observed minus every block's model
ucb.updates          # block internals live on YOUR objects, not the Wheel
```

[`examples/demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/examples/demo.ipynb) is the same walkthrough with
commentary, plus the `L1Data` long/short name aliases (`Tobs`, `fs`, `dt`,
...), the typo catcher, and attaching a constellation ephemeris. For a real
(toy) sampler — two conjugate-Gibbs source blocks plus a sampled
white-noise block, converging to known truth — run
[`examples/toy_fit.py`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/examples/toy_fit.py).

For a **real LISA source class**, [`examples/gb_block_eryn.ipynb`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/examples/gb_block_eryn.ipynb)
fits an injected galactic binary through the Wheel using GBGPU waveforms, an
Eryn sampler living inside the block, and a fixed LISA noise PSD from LISA
Analysis Tools. Everything that is *not* enchilada lives in
[`examples/gb_model.py`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/examples/gb_model.py), so the notebook shows only the
enchilada touchpoints. That example needs an external LISA stack — none of it
an enchilada dependency, so it is not exercised by CI:

```sh
uv pip install -r examples/requirements-gb.txt   # then --extra examples for JupyterLab
```

Every piece of it ships wheels, so nothing compiles. But `gbgpu` and
`lisaanalysistools` publish *no* sdist, which fixes the example's window
narrower than enchilada's own: **Python 3.12–3.13, on Linux or Apple-silicon
macOS**. Intel macOS, Windows, and 3.14 have no wheels, and pip reports that as
`No matching distribution found` rather than a build error — see the header of
[`examples/requirements-gb.txt`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/examples/requirements-gb.txt)
for the full matrix. Its outputs are not committed; run it to populate them.

## Plugging in your sampler

Implement the two-method `Block` protocol — see the docstrings in
[`src/enchilada/block.py`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/src/enchilada/block.py) for the full contract:

- `name` — unique within a Wheel; identifies you in diagnostics and errors.
- `start(residual) -> residual` — called once at registration; read the run
  settings off the residual, set yourself up, subtract your initial model,
  and return the updated residual (return it unchanged if you start from
  nothing).
- `update(residual) -> residual` — one block update per cycle. The residual you receive
  is the data with every **other** block's model subtracted — *not* your
  own. So it is exactly the data your source class must explain: fit it
  directly, subtract your new model, and return the result. There is no
  add-back; the Wheel keeps the ledger and derives your new entry from what
  you return.

`replace` is re-exported for convenience (`from enchilada import replace`), since
every block needs it to return an updated residual.

A block that models the noise instead of a signal removes nothing from the
data; it returns the residual with an updated `noise` object —
`replace(residual, noise=my_model)` (so its ledger entry is zero) — and signal
blocks read it back through `L1Data.noise_psd` for a frequency-domain
weight, or `L1Data.noise_variance` for the per-sample variance a time-domain
likelihood needs (enchilada does the PSD integration, including the Nyquist
weighting, so the answer does not depend on the parity of `n_samples`).

Everything about your sampler is *yours*: parameters, RNG, posterior chains,
checkpoints, and your own current model all live inside your block object
(or the external process it wraps) — the Wheel never sees or restores them. It
owns only the residual bookkeeping (the pristine data and the per-block
ledger). To log progress or checkpoint,
pass an `on_cycle` callback to `run` (or equivalently call `run(1)` in your
own loop) and read `wheel.residual()` — or anything off your own block
objects — between cycles.

The Wheel does not care how you sample or what language your sampler is
written in — a thin Python wrapper that shells out, moves files, and
implements these methods is indistinguishable from a native block.

Before plugging a block into a shared campaign, run the conformance check
in your own test suite:

```python
from enchilada.testing import check_block
check_block(MyBlock(name="ucb"), toy_observed)
```

It drives the full protocol on a scratch Wheel and raises a pointed error at
the first violation (a `start`/`update` that returns something other than a
valid `L1Data`, changes a fixed run setting, or — for a noise block —
puts a model on the residual that fails the noise contract). It needn't check
the residual bookkeeping — the Wheel owns that — but whether your *sampler*
recovers truth is still yours to verify; `examples/toy_fit.py` is the pattern.

## Conventions and consistency checking

Cross-group runs fail through silently mismatched conventions, so enchilada
makes every convention an explicit, validated part of `L1Data`:

- `observable` (required) — what the TDI samples physically are:
  `"fractional_frequency"`, `"phase"`, `"strain"`, or a campaign-agreed
  string. Every block reads this one field instead of assuming.
- `domain` — `"time"` (default, `n_samples` real samples per channel) or
  `"frequency"` (one-sided `dt * rfft(x)` spectra of length
  `n_samples // 2 + 1`). `n_samples` always counts time-domain samples, so
  `Tobs`/`df`/`dt` and the PSD grid stay well defined in both. The residual a
  block returns must keep the observed representation.
- `n_samples` — **you should never have to state it.** Data enters a campaign
  as a time series, where the arrays carry it exactly, so enchilada reads it
  off them; `residual.to_frequency()` then carries it across the transform:

  ```python
  observed = L1Data(tdi=time_series, sample_rate=fs, channels=("A", "E"),
                       tdi_generation="1.5", observable="fractional_frequency")
  spectrum = observed.to_frequency()      # n_samples rides along
  ```

  `to_frequency()`/`to_time()` apply the campaign's Fourier convention —
  `X(f) = dt * rfft(x)`, the one `noise_psd` is normalized against — so it is
  *executed* rather than merely documented, and the round trip is exact for
  either parity of n. Only a spectrum built with no time-domain provenance
  (e.g. straight from a frequency-domain waveform generator) has to state
  `n_samples`, because `n // 2 + 1` bins fit both n=1024 and n=1025, which mean
  different `Tobs` and `df`.
- `channels` — names imply the campaign's normalized definitions
  (e.g. A = (Z − X)/√2); see the `L1Data` docstring.

And it checks consistency at every boundary, failing loudly rather than
producing quietly wrong science:

- `L1Data` validates itself on every construction: tdi keys must equal
  `channels`, array lengths must match `domain`/`n_samples`, and an attached
  orbit must span the observation (catching GPS-vs-zero-based epoch
  mismatches at construction, not mid-run).
- The `Wheel` validates each block fully **before** registering it (`name`,
  `start` *and* `update`, so a failed `add` changes nothing), and re-validates the
  residual returned by every `start`/`update`: it must be an `L1Data` that kept
  the fixed run settings, must not have dropped the noise model, and must be
  finite — a NaN from a blown-up sampler is refused rather than handed to every
  block updated after it. `L1Data` itself rejects wrong tdi shapes *and
  dtypes*, so a mid-run drift raises immediately instead of corrupting the next
  block's residual. A noise model is checked where it is consumed
  (`noise_psd`/`noise_variance` raise if it lacks a `psd` method).
- Because the ledger is *derived* from what a block returns, a block that
  hands the residual straight back withdraws its model from the fit. That is
  almost never intended, so the Wheel warns when a previously non-zero model
  becomes exactly zero: re-subtract your current model on every block update, even when
  your parameters did not move.
- `NumericOrbit.positions` refuses to extrapolate outside its tabulated
  ephemeris instead of returning cubic-polynomial garbage.

## Orbits

The constellation ephemeris the data was produced with rides on
`L1Data.orbit` so every block builds its response from the *same*
spacecraft positions. `enchilada.orbits.NumericOrbit` tabulates and
cubic-spline-interpolates an ephemeris, with loaders for LDC/Mojito-style
HDF5 files (`from_hdf5`) and lisaorbits objects (`from_lisaorbits`); both
need the `numeric-orbits` extra. See the module docstring in
[`src/enchilada/orbits.py`](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/src/enchilada/orbits.py) for frames and
conventions.

## Development

```sh
uv sync --extra numeric-orbits   # dev group (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy)
uv run pytest                    # full suite, incl. examples and orbit loaders
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing   # coverage (gate: 95%)
uv run mypy                      # enchilada ships py.typed; keep it honest
uv run ruff check src tests examples
uv run ruff format --check src tests examples   # CI gates on this too
```

CI runs lint, formatting, mypy, the suite behind a 95% coverage gate, artifact
builds, and an installed-wheel smoke test across Python 3.12/3.13 on Linux and
macOS; plus a core-only leg (numpy alone, through 3.14) and a leg that resolves
to the declared dependency floors, so both claims are tested rather than
asserted. Tagging `v*` runs the same gate and publishes via PyPI Trusted
Publishing. See
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/enchilada/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.

## Known limitations

Deliberate scope decisions, recorded so they are choices rather than
oversights:

- **No data-quality / gap mask.** Every sample is treated as carrying
  information. Real LISA data has scheduled gaps (antenna repointing) and
  excised glitches, and a mask is exactly the kind of convention that belongs
  in `L1Data` — otherwise each group invents its own. It is left out while
  the datasets in play are gap-free, because a field nobody exercises would be
  guessed at rather than designed. **TODO: add it as soon as the simulated data
  grows gaps.** Adding the field later is additive, not breaking; what
  breaks is the *semantics* (whether the ledger arithmetic and the PSD grid
  respect it), so the bill is a future behaviour change, not a major version — see the "Deliberately not in the contract yet" section of the
  `L1Data` docstring for the specific decisions it involves (representation,
  whether the Wheel's arithmetic must respect it, what the PSD grid means over
  a gap, and whether windowing becomes a campaign convention too).
- **One noise model at a time.** `L1Data.noise` is a single slot, so two
  noise blocks (say instrument noise and galactic confusion) cannot each own a
  component and have enchilada combine them — the last block to write it
  wins. Sample them inside one noise block that publishes a combined model,
  or treat the confusion foreground as a signal block that subtracts from
  `tdi`, where the ledger *does* combine contributions. The Wheel no longer
  loses this silently: dropping the model is an error, and a second block
  writing the slot raises `NoiseOverwrittenWarning`. It stays a warning
  because handing ownership between blocks may be deliberate.
- **No lifecycle end.** The `Block` protocol is `start` plus `update` — there
  is no `close`/`finalize`, and the Wheel never signals that a campaign is
  over. That matters mainly for the wrap-an-external-process case the protocol
  invites: the subprocess, MPI job or scratch directory behind your wrapper is
  yours to tear down. You constructed the block objects and you hold the
  references, so `run()` returning is the signal; use a context manager on your
  own wrapper if you want it automatic.

## Scaling

The Wheel's own cost is `n_blocks` × (two full-array copies + one subtraction
per *other* block) per cycle, so it grows a little faster than linearly in the
number of blocks. Measured on 4.2M samples × 3 channels (101 MB per copy),
with do-nothing blocks so this is orchestration only:

| blocks | ms/cycle | ms/block |
|-------:|---------:|---------:|
|      1 |       25 |       25 |
|      4 |      113 |       28 |
|      8 |      295 |       37 |
|     16 |      885 |       55 |

Those are one laptop, memory-bandwidth bound, and vary ±20% run to run — the
shape is the point, not the absolute numbers. The quadratic term does not
overtake the fixed per-block copies until roughly 16 blocks, so a realistic 5–8 block campaign pays ~0.1–0.3 s per cycle — next
to nothing against blocks whose samplers each run hundreds of likelihood
evaluations. If profiling ever says otherwise, forming the full residual once
per cycle and adding each block's own entry back turns the `O(n_blocks²)` term
into `O(n_blocks)`; that add-back would live inside the Wheel, never in a
block.

## Status

0.1.0 — the first tagged release, and an alpha: the protocol is settled enough
to build blocks against, but interfaces may still move, so pin a version for a
running campaign. MIT licensed. Issues and questions welcome.
