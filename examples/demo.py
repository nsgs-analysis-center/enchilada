"""Minimal enchilada demo: the L1Data / Block / Wheel plumbing, end to end.

Runs three blocked-Gibbs cycles over two no-op EchoBlocks on synthetic
data -- no real waveforms or MCMC, just enough to watch the Wheel hand each
block its residual. Run it with:

    uv run python examples/demo.py

See examples/demo.ipynb for the same walkthrough with commentary.
