"""Helpers for sanity-checking the enchilada interface.

Importable utilities for verifying that the Wheel/Block protocol works
end-to-end without needing a real waveform model:

- :class:`EchoBlock` -- a no-op block that prints what the Wheel hands
  it; useful for watching the plumbing.
- :func:`check_block` -- a conformance check for your own Block
  implementation; run it in your test suite before plugging into a shared
  campaign.

def check_block(block: Block, observed: L1Data, n_cycles: int = 2) -> None:
    """Conformance check for a `Block` implementation.

    Drives the full Wheel protocol against `observed` on a scratch Wheel and
    verifies:

    - `start` returns a valid `L1Data` that keeps every run setting
      unchanged (only `tdi`/`noise` may move);
    - each of `n_cycles` block updates does the same (mid-run drift raises);
    - if the block sets a noise model on the residual (a noise block),
      that model satisfies the consumption contract -- `residual.noise_psd`
      succeeds rather than raising for want of a `psd` method.

    It also escalates the `ModelWithdrawnWarning` the Wheel merely warns about,
    so a block that stops re-subtracting its model fails here rather than
    quietly leaving the fit later. (If your block legitimately drops to a
    zero model during these cycles -- a death move -- give it a starting state
    that does not, or filter the warning around your own call.)

    It does not check the residual bookkeeping -- the `Wheel` owns that, so
    there is no cross-block arithmetic in a block to get wrong (see the
    `Wheel` docstring for the ledger). Whether your *sampler* recovers truth
    is still yours to verify; `examples/toy_fit.py` is the pattern.

    Raises with a pointed message at the first violation; returns quietly
    when the block conforms. Run this in your own test suite before
    plugging a block into a shared campaign:
