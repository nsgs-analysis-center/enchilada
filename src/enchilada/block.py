    """Plug a sampler into the Wheel by implementing this interface.

    The Wheel hands you a residual and takes back your updated one. It calls
    two methods on you:

    - `start` once, when you are registered. Read the run settings and
      conventions off the residual, set yourself up, subtract your initial
      model, and return the updated residual (return it unchanged if you
      start from nothing).
    - `update` once each cycle -- one **block update**. The residual you
      receive is the observed data with **every other** block's model already
      subtracted -- **but not your own**. So it is exactly the data your
      source class must explain: fit against it directly, subtract your new
      model, and return the result. There is nothing to add back.

    No add-back. The Wheel keeps a ledger of every block's current model and
    hands you the data minus *everyone else*, so your own model is never in
    what you receive. You fit it as-is. When you return, the Wheel reads your
    new ledger entry straight off the difference between what it handed you and
    what you returned -- you never do the cross-block arithmetic, and there
    is no add-back to forget. (This is why the Wheel, not the block, owns the
    residual bookkeeping; you still own everything about your sampler.)

    What is yours. Your parameters, your RNG, your posterior chain, your
    proposal tuning, your checkpoints, and your current model all live inside
    your object (or the external process it wraps). The Wheel never sees,
    stores, or restores your sampler state; it only records the summed model
    you produce, so it can form the next residual.

    The pattern:

        from enchilada import replace   # or: from dataclasses import replace

        def update(self, residual):
            tdi = dict(residual.tdi)             # keep the channels you do not touch
            for ch in residual.channels:
                data = tdi[ch]                   # already data minus OTHERS
                self.amplitude = draw_against(data, self.template)  # your sample
                tdi[ch] = data - self.amplitude * self.template     # subtract yours
            return replace(residual, tdi=tdi)

    Noise is not special. A block that models the noise instead of a signal
    removes nothing from `tdi`; it returns the residual with an updated `noise`
    object -- `replace(residual, noise=my_model)` -- so its ledger entry is
    zero, and signal blocks read the model back through `residual.noise_psd`
    (per-bin weight) or `residual.noise_variance` (per-sample variance, for a
    time-domain likelihood). See `NoiseBlock`.

    `isinstance(x, Block)` is a *shape* check, not a semantic one. `Block` is
    runtime-checkable, so it tests only that `x` has `name`, `start` and
    `update` -- and those are common enough names that a progress bar or an
    online learner can pass. Use it to catch an obviously wrong object early;
    do not read a pass as "this is a block." `Wheel.add` does not rely on it
    (it checks each method itself and validates what `start` returns).

    Implementation notes:
        - `name` must be unique within a Wheel; it identifies your block in
          diagnostics and error messages.
        - Return an `L1Data` with the same run settings you were handed
          (`channels`, `n_samples`, `sample_rate`, `domain`, `epoch`,
          `tdi_generation`, `observable`, `orbit`); only `tdi` and `noise` may
          change. The Wheel validates this after `start` and every `update`, and
          `L1Data` itself validates that your `tdi` keeps the right keys and
          shapes.
        - You are handed a fresh copy of the `tdi` arrays each call, so you may
          mutate them in place if convenient; just return the result. The
          `noise` and `orbit` objects are shared by reference -- treat them as
          immutable, swapping via `replace(residual, noise=...)` rather than
          mutating in place.
        - `residual.noise` may be `None`: either no noise model is set, or on
          the first cycle you are updated before the noise block is
          (registration order). Both `noise_psd()` and `noise_variance()`
          return `None` in that case -- guard for it rather than assuming a
          model is present.
        - Read the data conventions off the residual instead of assuming them:
          `residual.observable`, `residual.domain`, `residual.channels`. If
          your sampler only supports one convention, check these in `start` and
          raise.
        - For samplers in another language, write a thin Python wrapper that
          shells out, writes/reads files, and implements this protocol. The
          wrapper (or the process behind it) carries all the state; the Wheel
          cannot tell the difference.

class NoiseBlock(Block, Protocol):
    """Convention for a `Block` that models the noise, not a signal.

    Structurally identical to `Block` -- a noise block implements the same
    `start`/`update` -- but by convention it leaves `tdi` untouched (so its
    ledger entry is zero) and instead returns the residual with an updated
    `noise` object:

        def update(self, residual):
            model = self.estimate_noise(residual.tdi)  # residual is ~pure noise
            return replace(residual, noise=model)

    The `noise` object it puts on the residual is consumed by signal blocks
    through `L1Data.noise_psd` (and `L1Data.noise_variance`, which
    integrates it for time-domain use), so it must expose

    - ``psd(freqs[, channel]) -> ndarray`` -- the one-sided PSD (see
      `L1Data.noise_psd` for the pinned normalization convention).

    `isinstance(block, NoiseBlock)` cannot tell you anything -- it returns True
    for *every* block. That is not a bug to fix: a noise block declares no
    method a signal block lacks, because the difference between them is what
    they do with `tdi` and `noise`, not their shape. Use this protocol as
    documentation and as a type annotation; to find the noise block in a
    campaign, track which one you registered for that job.

    That contract is enforced where the model is consumed (`noise_psd` raises
    if it is missing), not by the Wheel, which stays entirely noise-agnostic.
    The Wheel threads the updated noise onto every residual it forms after, so
    every block updated later sees the refreshed estimate.
