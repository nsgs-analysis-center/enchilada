    The ledger is *derived* (what a block was handed minus what it returned),

      whose last source died, or a cadenced block with nothing to contribute
      this cycle. Nothing is wrong.
    * the block failed to re-subtract the model it still believes it has --
      a wrapper whose external process errored, an all-rejected cycle returned
      as "no change" -- and its model has silently left the fit.

    It warns rather than raises because it is a heuristic about intent. If the
    first case is yours, silence it precisely::

        warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=enchilada.ModelWithdrawnWarning)

    `enchilada.testing.check_block` escalates it to an error, on the grounds

class NoiseOverwrittenWarning(RuntimeWarning):
    """Two blocks are writing `L1Data.noise`, so one is losing.

    `noise` is a single slot: whichever block writes last owns the model every

    almost never what you want when two blocks each maintain a component --
    instrument noise and the galactic confusion foreground, say -- because the
    Wheel does not combine them, it just keeps the last one.

    Fix it by sampling both components inside a single noise block that
    publishes one combined model, or by treating the foreground as a signal
    block that subtracts from `tdi` (where the ledger *does* combine
    contributions). If you really do mean to hand ownership between blocks,

class Wheel:
    """Runs a blocked-Gibbs global fit by handing each block a clean residual.

    The Wheel keeps the pristine observed data and a **ledger** -- one entry
    per block holding that block's current model contribution (its summed
    waveform, as a channel -> array dict). From those it can form any residual
    by subtraction, and it hands each block exactly the residual that block
    should fit: the observed data minus **every other** block's current model
    (never the block's own). The block fits against that, subtracts its new
    model, and returns the updated residual; the Wheel reads the block's new
    ledger entry straight off the difference between what it handed out and what
    came back.

    Why this shape. Because a block is only ever shown the data with its own
    model already removed, there is no "add-back" to remember and no way to
    forget one -- the classic silent failure of residual passing is structurally
    impossible here. The ledger is a required, automatically-consistent product
    of every return; the block never does the cross-block arithmetic.

    What lives where. The block owns its *sampler* state -- parameters, RNG,
    chain, checkpoints -- and the Wheel never touches it. The Wheel owns the
    *residual* state -- the pristine data and the per-block contribution
    ledger -- and does all the differencing. (This is the split the GLASS
    global fit uses: blocks own their samplers, the framework owns the residual
    bookkeeping.)

    Consistency checking. `add` validates a block fully before recording it
    (`name`, `start` and `update`; a `start` that fails leaves the Wheel
    untouched), and every `start`/`update` return must be an `L1Data` that

    * kept the fixed run settings (`_INVARIANT`) -- only `tdi` and `noise` move;
    * kept the same `orbit` object;
    * did not drop a noise model that was set;
    * contains no NaN or inf.

    `L1Data` itself re-validates shapes and dtypes, so a mid-run drift
    raises immediately. Two failures are only warnings, because neither can be
    proven wrong from outside: a model that vanishes
    (`ModelWithdrawnWarning`) and a second block writing the single `noise`
    slot (`NoiseOverwrittenWarning`).

    Noise. Signal blocks whiten against `residual.noise`. Two ways to supply
    it:

    * Fixed noise -- set it once on the observed data
      (`observed = replace(observed, noise=...)`); it rides every handed
      residual and never changes.
    * Sampled noise -- register a noise block (one that returns the residual
      with an updated `noise` and its tdi untouched, so its ledger entry is
      zero; see `block.NoiseBlock`). Every block updated after it sees the
      refreshed estimate.

    Typical use:

        observed = L1Data(tdi=..., sample_rate=...,
                             channels=("A", "E", "T"),
