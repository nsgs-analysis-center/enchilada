@dataclass(frozen=True, eq=False)
class L1Data:
    """L1 data plus the fixed settings that say how to interpret it.

    One `L1Data` object is constructed at the top of a run to hold the observed
    data and the campaign settings (sample rate, channels, epoch, ...). The
    Wheel produces a new `L1Data` object each cycle of the wheel with the same
    metadata fields but freshly computed residual `tdi` -- the data with every
    other block's current model subtracted.

    Every field below is part of the cross-group data contract, and
    `__post_init__` validates the whole object on every construction
    (including the `replace(...)` the Wheel performs each cycle): tdi keys
    must equal `channels`, array lengths must match `domain`/`n_samples`,
    and an attached `orbit` must span the observation. Inconsistent data
    fails loudly at construction, not deep inside a sampler.

    Fields:
        tdi: Channel name -> 1D array. Keys match `channels` exactly. In the
            time domain (`domain="time"`) each array holds `n_samples` real
            samples. In the frequency domain (`domain="frequency"`) each
            array holds the one-sided spectrum on the rfft grid of the
            underlying time series -- length `n_samples // 2 + 1`, with the
            continuous-transform normalization `dt * np.fft.rfft(x)`.
        sample_rate: Samples per second, in Hz.
        n_samples: Number of *time-domain* samples per channel -- always,
            even when `domain="frequency"` (it pins the duration, so
            `Tobs`/`df`/`dt` and the PSD grid stay well defined).

            **Omit it for time-domain data**: the arrays are exactly that
            long, so it is read off them and stating it again is duplication.

            **Frequency-domain data must specify it.** An rfft of a length-n
            real series has `n // 2 + 1` bins, which loses the parity of n:
            513 bins are consistent with n=1024 *and* n=1025, and those imply
            different `Tobs` and `df`.
        channels: TDI channel names in this run, e.g. ("A", "E", "T").
        tdi_generation: TDI generation string, e.g. "1.5" or "2.0".
        observable: Physical interpretation of the data. Recommended values:
            "fractional_frequency" (relative frequency deviation dnu/nu, the
            LDC / lisainstrument default), "phase" (radians), "strain".
            Campaign-specific strings are allowed; every block reads this
            one field, so agreement is by construction -- state it once,
            correctly, rather than letting each group assume its own.
        domain: "time" (default) or "frequency". Selects the tdi
            representation described above; the model a block returns
            must keep it (`L1Data` validates the tdi shapes).
        epoch: GPS seconds corresponding to sample index 0. Defaults to
            ``0.0`` -- fine for synthetic data with no absolute-time
            reference. Set it for real data: it anchors the constellation
            response (spacecraft positions at `epoch + n*dt`), the orbit-span
            check, and the frequency-domain phase reference. Shadowed by `t0`.
        noise: The current noise/covariance model the residual should be
            whitened with, or `None`. Noise blocks update this field and
            on the model they return, and the Wheel copies that model to
            every other block. `None` when no noise model is set. See
            `block.NoiseBlock`.
        orbit: The LISA constellation ephemeris  --
            the spacecraft positions every block must share to build its
            response (see `enchilada.orbits.Orbit`). Currently a *fixed* property
            of the dataset, like `epoch`/`tdi_generation`: set it once on the
            observed data and the Wheel copies it unchanged. Blocks read `data.orbit`
            rather than constructing their own, ensuring every piece
            uses the *same* constellation. `None` lets a block fall back to
            its own default orbit (back-compatible with orbit-less runs).

    Derived properties are exposed under both descriptive long names and
    the short symbols LISA papers use. Both spellings return the same value
    -- pick whichever reads better in context, but prefer *one* consistently
    within a given block or script so readers are not tracking two
    vocabularies. Call `L1Data.aliases()` for the full long-to-short table.

    Equality is identity (`eq=False`). A generated `__eq__` would compare the
    tdi arrays elementwise and raise "truth value of an array is ambiguous",
    so `r1 == r2` is True only for the same object -- which is also what the
    Wheel's orbit check relies on. Use `numpy.allclose` on the arrays to
    compare contents.

        The frequency-domain noise piece: the per-bin variance a Fourier-domain

        grid (from `n_samples`/`sample_rate`) so blocks never recompute the
        normalization. DC (bin 0) is ``+inf`` (zero weight). Returns ``None``
        when no noise model is set (`self.noise is None`).

        Pass `channel` (e.g. `"A"`, `"E"`, `"T"`) for the per-channel PSD -- LISA's
        A and E share a PSD but T (the null channel) differs, so a likelihood that
        models T must weight it by its own noise. `channel=None` (the default)
        calls the model's plain `psd(freqs)`, preserving back-compatibility with
        noise objects that expose only an A/E PSD.

        Requires the threaded noise object to expose ``psd(freqs[, channel])``.
        The grid has length ``n_samples // 2 + 1``, so in a frequency-domain
        run (`domain="frequency"`) it lines up bin-for-bin with the tdi arrays.

        Normalization is the **one-sided** PSD in units of ``[observable]**2 / Hz``,

        so a frequency-domain block's per-bin weight is
        ``|X(f)|**2 / ((Tobs/2) S)`` for the interior bins. Two bins are not
        interior: DC (set to ``+inf`` here, so it carries zero weight) and, when
        ``n_samples`` is even, the Nyquist bin, which is purely real and carries
